# React

1. React State Management Functions

Function	Usage
useState	Manages local component state. Ideal for UI-based state like form inputs.
useReducer	Alternative to useState for complex state logic (e.g., state transitions).
useContext	Shares state between components without prop drilling. Often used with React.createContext().
useRef	Maintains references to DOM elements or persistent values without re-renders.
useMemo	Optimizes performance by memoizing values based on dependencies.
useCallback	Memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders in child components.
useEffect	Performs side effects like fetching data or setting up event listeners.
useLayoutEffect	is similar to useEffect but runs synchronously after DOM mutations.

2. Key React Patterns

Pattern	Description
Higher-Order Components (HOC)	A function that takes a component and returns an enhanced version of it. Example: withAuth(Component).
Render Props	A pattern where a function is passed as a prop to dynamically render content.
Compound Components	Groups related components together for better composition (e.g., <Accordion> with <AccordionItem>).
Controlled Components	Form inputs are controlled by the React state instead of the DOM.
Uncontrolled Components	Form elements that rely on the DOM state using useRef.
Context API	Shares state globally without prop drilling.
Suspense & Lazy Loading	Dynamically loads components when needed using React.lazy().
Portals	Renders components outside the main React tree, useful for modals.





### 2. SSSR (Streaming Server-Side Rendering)

Streaming Server-Side Rendering (SSSR) is an advanced React rendering technique that enables a server to send parts of a page to the client as soon as they are ready, rather than waiting for the entire page to be fully generated. This technique improves performance by:

- **Reducing Time-to-First-Byte (TTFB):** Content is streamed progressively, allowing users to see meaningful content sooner.
- **Enabling progressive hydration:** Components are rendered and hydrated as they load, improving interactivity.
- **Utilizing React’s built-in streaming APIs:** `ReactDOMServer.renderToNodeStream()` (pre-React 18) and `renderToPipeableStream()` (React 18+).

#### **Use Case**
Imagine an e-commerce website where the header, navigation bar, and product list can be loaded quickly, but customer reviews take longer due to database queries. Using SSSR, the server can send the header and navigation first, allowing users to start interacting with the page while the customer reviews are still being fetched and streamed in later.

### **Other Similar Rendering Techniques**

#### 1. **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)**
- Renders content entirely in the browser using JavaScript.
- Requires downloading and executing the JavaScript bundle before displaying anything.
- Example: Single Page Applications (SPAs) using React.

#### 2. **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**
- The server generates the full HTML page before sending it to the client.
- Reduces initial load time but can block rendering until all data is fetched.
- Uses `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()`.

#### 3. **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**
- Combines static site generation (SSG) with dynamic updates at runtime.
- Pages are generated at build time but can be updated in response to user requests.
- Used in Next.js with `getStaticProps` and revalidation intervals.

#### 4. **RSC (React Server Components)**
- Introduced in React 18, allowing components to be rendered on the server while keeping stateful and interactive components client-side.
- Reduces bundle size by offloading logic to the server.
- Compatible with Next.js App Router (`app/` directory).

### **Conclusion**
SSSR is a powerful rendering approach for improving performance and user experience, particularly for data-heavy applications where certain content can be loaded progressively. Understanding when to use SSSR versus other rendering strategies like SSR, CSR, or ISR is key to optimizing React applications.

Explaining SSSR 
	1.	Start with a high-level definition:
“Streaming Server-Side Rendering (SSSR) is an advanced React rendering technique where the server streams parts of the page to the client as they become available, instead of waiting for the entire page to be generated.”
	2.	Mention the key benefits:
	•	Reduces Time-to-First-Byte (TTFB) by sending content progressively.
	•	Allows progressive hydration, making the page interactive faster.
	•	Uses renderToPipeableStream() (React 18+) for efficient streaming.
	3.	Give a practical example:
	•	Imagine an e-commerce website where the navigation and product list load instantly, while customer reviews are still fetching in the background. SSSR allows the user to interact with the page while waiting for additional content to load progressively.
	4.	Differentiate from traditional SSR:
	•	SSR waits for the entire page to be ready before sending it to the client, which can slow down performance if data fetching takes time. SSSR improves this by streaming content as soon as it’s available.

How to Present This in an Interview
	•	Keep it structured: Definition → Benefits → Example → Comparison
	•	Use real-world analogies: “SSSR is like watching a video that streams instantly instead of waiting for the whole file to download.”
	•	Connect it to React concepts: “It works well with Suspense for streaming dynamic content.”
	•	Use keywords: Streaming, Progressive Hydration, React 18, Performance Optimization.



# GraphQL
 

## AEM Headless Architecture with GraphQL

### 1. Understanding AEM Headless Architecture

AEM’s headless CMS capability allows developers to separate the content management backend (AEM) from the frontend, which can be built using React, Next.js, Vue.js, or any other framework. Instead of serving HTML pages, AEM exposes structured content via APIs (GraphQL or REST), which frontend applications consume dynamically.

#### Key Features of AEM Headless:
- **Content Fragment Models**: Define reusable content structures (e.g., article, product, event).
- **Content Delivery via APIs**: Fetch structured content using GraphQL API or REST API.
- **Decoupled Frontend**: React, Next.js, or any frontend framework can consume AEM content.
- **Efficient Content Management**: Authors can use AEM’s UI while developers work with APIs.

---

### 2. Why Use GraphQL in AEM Headless?

AEM supports GraphQL as an efficient alternative to REST for fetching content.

#### Advantages of GraphQL in AEM:
✅ Fetch only the required data (no over-fetching or under-fetching).  
✅ Retrieve nested content in a single request (better performance).  
✅ Reduce API calls compared to REST.  
✅ Supports complex queries with filters, pagination, and sorting.  

---

### 3. How AEM GraphQL Works?

AEM’s GraphQL API provides access to Content Fragments (CFs) stored in the JCR (Java Content Repository).

#### Steps to Use AEM GraphQL API:

1. **Enable GraphQL Endpoint**  
   - Navigate to AEM Configuration Console (`/system/console/configMgr`).  
   - Enable GraphQL servlet under Adobe Granite GraphQL Endpoint.

2. **Create a Content Fragment Model**  
   - Go to **AEM > Tools > Assets > Content Fragment Models**.  
   - Define a model (e.g., Blog, Product, Event) with necessary fields (title, description, image, author).

3. **Create Content Fragments**  
   - Go to **AEM > Assets > Content Fragments** and create fragments based on the model.

4. **Construct GraphQL Queries**  
   - AEM provides a GraphQL playground (`/graphql/execute.json/{endpoint}`).
   - Example GraphQL Query to fetch blog content:

```graphql
{
  blogByPath(_path: "/content/dam/blogs/sample") {
    item {
      title
      description
      author {
        name
        bio
      }
      image {
        _path
      }
    }
  }
}
```

5. **Consume AEM GraphQL API in React**  
   - Use Apollo Client or Fetch API to get AEM content in a React app.
   - Example using Apollo Client in React:

```javascript
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql } from "@apollo/client";

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "https://your-aem-instance/graphql/execute.json/your-endpoint",
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

const GET_BLOGS = gql`
  {
    blogByPath(_path: "/content/dam/blogs/sample") {
      item {
        title
        description
        author {
          name
          bio
        }
        image {
          _path
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

client.query({ query: GET_BLOGS }).then((response) => console.log(response.data));
```

### 4. AEM Headless + GraphQL + React Architecture

📌 **Architecture Flow:**  
1️⃣ Content authors create & manage Content Fragments in AEM.  
2️⃣ AEM exposes content via GraphQL API.  
3️⃣ Frontend (React/Next.js) fetches content dynamically.  
4️⃣ Data is displayed on the frontend with real-time updates.  

**[AEM CMS] ---> [GraphQL API] ---> [React Frontend]**

---

### 5. Advanced GraphQL Features in AEM

🔹 **Filtering:**
```graphql
{
  blogByPath(_path: "/content/dam/blogs/sample") {
    item {
      title
      description
    }
  }
}
```

🔹 **Pagination:**
```graphql
{
  blogList(limit: 5, offset: 10) {
    items {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

🔹 **Nested Queries:**
```graphql
{
  productByPath(_path: "/content/dam/products/shirt") {
    item {
      name
      price
      category {
        name
      }
      reviews {
        user
        rating
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 6. Deployment Considerations

✅ **AEM as a Cloud Service**: Use AEM Headless API on Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service for scalability.  
✅ **Caching & Performance**: Use CDN (Akamai, CloudFront) and GraphQL caching for faster responses.  
✅ **Authentication**: Secure GraphQL API with OAuth/JWT for protected content.  
✅ **SSG/ISR with Next.js**: Optimize performance using Static Site Generation (SSG) or Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).
